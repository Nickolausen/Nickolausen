## `$ whoami`
I'm a **full-time student** @ University of Bologna, Computer Science and Engineering course - Cesena Campus. 

I consider myself as an _eager_ and _highly motivated_ **learner**, quite often trying to go beyond the 'educational level' of concepts taught during lectures.

I'm currently spending a slice of my spare time trying to learn new popular and niche technologies such as **React.js** for Web Development (in order to develop my personal portfolio and academic notes collector), **LateX** (which I use to organize lecture notes) and **Manim** (a Python library created by the famous YouTuber and Math popularizer _3blue1brown_).

I tutor some High School students in Math and Computer Science as odd job, and sometimes I carry out projects that helps me discover new technologies and techniques. I've recently dived into Vue.js and Python, which are in my to-learn list.

I have a personal website (which is *work in progress*), serving solely as portfolio for the moment - more features are going to be added in a foreseeable future: [nicholasmagi.it](https://nicholasmagi.it).

For university-related projects, see my organization [`@NickolausenTheAcademic`](https://github.com/NickolausenTheAcademic).
